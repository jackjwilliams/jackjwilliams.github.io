## Intro
I recently attended my first developer conference - [Code on the Beach 2015](https://www.codeonthebeach.com/) - and I must say - it was amazing! Among all the great talks, one caught my attention by Elijah Manor (Keynote) where he talks about [growing developers](https://www.codeonthebeach.com/cotb2015/session/3124/growing-developers). One thing I haven't done much of as a developer is share. I take all the time (reading blogs, researching answers to problems, stackoverflow, etc...), then I build - and leave it at that. This is my first attempt at giving - on to the good stuff!

## Hangfire
I've been working on a project lately where some processes were getting bogged down due to some long running commands / queries. Rightly so, as the first iteration I was trying to get the concept up and running - no optimization. When it came time to put some tasks in the background - we decided to go with [Hangfire](http://hangfire.io/). This post will focus mainly on the setting up and implementation of Hangfire with SimpleInjector and MVC 5.

### Database Setup with Local / Staging / Develop / Production Environments
One issue I had upon first deploying Hangfire was how to automate the creation of the Hangfire databases. With so many environments I did not want to re-use the same database for each and definitely didn't want to have to create each one manually.

#### Local Dev Environment Problem
The [documentation](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-sql-server.html) states that:

> SQL Server objects are being installed **automatically** from the SqlServerStorage constructor by executing statements described in the Install.sql file (which is located under the tools folder in the NuGet package). Which contains the migration script, so new versions of Hangfire with schema changes can be installed seamlessly, without your intervention.

But this never happened for me - locally I use a (LocalDb) file, and if it didn't exist Hangfire barfed:
{% highlight xml %}
An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\....\App_Data\Hangfire.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share.
{% endhighlight %}

Bare with me as I'm still learning Jekyll + Markdown + Pygments (how can I do error highlighting?!)

#### Solution
After mucking around for awhile I decided to use something I know quite a bit about: Entity Framework. EF makes it easy to create (and even migrate, even though we dont need that for Hangfire) databases automatically.  All I really needed was one DbContext class, and here it is:

{% highlight c# %}
public class HangfireContext : DbContext
{
    public HangfireContext() : base("name=HangfireContext")
    {
        Database.SetInitializer<HangfireContext>(null);
        Database.CreateIfNotExists();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In all of my web.configs (Develop, Production, Staging, etc...) the database points to the correct server and database (Hangfire_Staging, Hangfire_Developer, (LocalDb) for local dev). This creates the database for me in any new environment I stand up! All I have to do is instantiate it.

##### DB Initialization
I used the HangfireBootstrapper.cs example from the [documentation](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/deployment-to-production/making-aspnet-app-always-running.html), with some slight modifications:

{% highlight c# %}
public void Start()
{
    lock (_lockObject)
    {
        if (_started) return;
        _started = true;

        HostingEnvironment.RegisterObject(this);
        
        //This will create the DB if it doesn't exist
        var db = new HangfireContext();

        GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSqlServerStorage("HangfireContext");

        var options = new BackgroundJobServerOptions()
        {
            ServerName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["HangfireServerName"]
        };

        _backgroundJobServer = new BackgroundJobServer(options);

        var jobStarter = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService<JobBootstrapper>();

        jobStarter.Bootstrap();
               
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Multiple IIS Sites Hosted Under Virtual Directory
Our dev/staging site structure looks like this
- http://site.com/APP_Develop/
- http://site.com/APP_Staging/
- ...

When spinning up hangfire for the first time the only site that had any servers listed was APP_Develop. I am guessing this is because all servers were on the same machine so I had to name the servers accordingly. This fixes that:

{% highlight c# %}
var options = new BackgroundJobServerOptions()
{
	ServerName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["HangfireServerName"]
};
{% endhighlight %}

#### Recurring Jobs + SimpleInjector
To create RecurringJobs easily we roll out some interfaces and wire them up using SimpleInjector.

##### IRecurringJob Interface

{% highlight c# %}
public interface IRecurringJob
{
    void Work();

    string When { get; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

##### IRecurringJob Implementation
{% highlight c# %}
public class Daily_ExpireSomeEntityJob : IRecurringJob
{
    private readonly IRepository _repo;

    public Daily_ExpireSomeEntityJob(IRepository repo)
    {
        _repo = repo;
    }

    public void Work()
    {
        var now = DateTime.Now;
        
        var entities =
            _repo.GetAll<SomeEntity>().Where(x => x.ExpirationDate <= now);
            
        entities.Each(x => x.Expired = true);
    }

    public string When
    {
        get { return Cron.Daily(23, 50); }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

##### Container Registration

Note: I'm sure theres a better way to register all implementations, I just have not found it yet.

{% highlight c# %}
container.RegisterAll<IRecurringJob>(typeof(Daily_ExpireSomeEntityJob),typeof(Daily_SendOutSomeNotificationJob));
{% endhighlight %}

##### JobBootstrapper

{% highlight c# %}
public class JobBootstrapper
{
    private readonly IEnumerable<IRecurringJob> _recurringJobs;

    public JobBootstrapper(IEnumerable<IRecurringJob> recurringJobs)
    {
        _recurringJobs = recurringJobs;
    }

    public void Bootstrap()
    {
        var manager = new RecurringJobManager();

        foreach (var job in _recurringJobs)
        {
            var type = job.GetType();
            var method = type.GetMethod("Work");
            var j = new Job(type, method);

            manager.AddOrUpdate(type.Name, j, job.When);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
