## Fear Not, It Can Be Done

Let me first give accolades to Jeffery Palermo. He did a bootcamp on Continuous Delivery at the Kansas City Developer Conferencce that I attended - it really made me re-think our CD process. It was his kindness and helpfulness to other developers and I that reminded me I need to give back as well. I've been a long time reader of his blogs and books, and overall fan. It was really cool to meet him in person and see how much of a helping spirit he has.

I've been meaning to blog about this but just haven't found the time. Now is as good a time as any, I just got done with day one of the KCDC.

### Background

On the project I'm currently working on I had to figure out how to setup autoscaling with Octopus Deploy - and it was no simple feat. There wasn't a ton of information on this topic. This post details the process I came up with to handle this.
