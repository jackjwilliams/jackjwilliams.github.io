## The Problem

Recently I started doing WPF development and learned that deployments are not as easy to handle as web applications. With a web application, using Teamcity & Octopus Deploy, it's easy to build, deploy and promote between environments. Because it's "hosted", in one spot, on a web server. But what about a WPF application for a large company with thousands of employees?

How do you "promote" a WPF from "Nightly" to "Beta" when hundreds or thousands of users have it installed on their desktop?

Damn good question.
